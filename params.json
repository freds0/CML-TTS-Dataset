  "body": "### Project Description\r\nThis project aims to evaluate computational methods for automating the assessment of patients’ transcribed retellings, enabling their application on a large scale and in a longitudinal evaluation. The advantage of automating the retelling assessment is to make corrections consistent when checking number of recalled narrative elements by the patient and the large-scale application of neuropsychological tests. In this project, sentence segmentation techniques will be applied to automate the retelling of immediate and delayed narratives belonging to the episodic memory subtest of the Arizona Battery for Communication Disorders of Dementia in Portuguese. Thus, it will be possible to extract metrics available on Coh-Metrix-Dementia that depend on correct parsing, such as the Idea Density metric. To evaluate the methods developed here, we will use narratives of patients from (i) the Reference Center in Cognitive Disorders (CEREDIC), at the Medical School of the University of São Paulo (FMUSP) and (ii) the research group at the Linguistic Department at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS). \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMarcos Vinícius Treviso (@mtreviso); Christopher Shulby (@cshulby); Sandra Maria Aluísio (sandra at icmc.usp.br).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to contact me at _marcostreviso@usp.br_\r\n",
